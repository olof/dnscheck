=head1 NAME

dnscheck-preflight - quickly check if a name seems to be a delegated domain or not

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The dnscheck-preflight script takes a name and tries to figure out if that
name corresponds to a delegated domain or not, without taking too much time
about it (at least in theory, it should never use more than just over six
seconds).

There are no options. The script will print the string TRUE to standard output
if it thinks the name is a delegated domain, and the string FALSE otherwise.

A domain will be considered to exist if any of the following is true:

=over

=item

An NS record can be found.

=item

A SOA record can be found.

=item

A query for either of the above gets a SERVFAIL response.

=item

A query for either of the above times out.
